items are worked through retrospectively to identify any traces of the activities in logs and assess if there is sufficient
prevention and detection mechanisms in place to defend against similar actions in future.

Note:

* All times are represented in UTC
* The following definitions are used:
  * **Detected**:
    * *Not Applicable* - It is not reasonable to expect this event to be identified by the target organisation
    * *Unknown* - It was not possible to determine if the event was recorded or resulted in an alert from an attacker's perspective.
    * *No Trace* - There was no logging or telemetry which captured the event
    * *Event Recorded* - The event is retrospectively recognisable in logs or telemetry but did not result in an alert being raised at the time of the event
    * *Alert Raised* - The event was sufficiently beyond baseline activity as to trigger an automated alert which was fed to the defensive team
  * **Prevented**:
    * *Not Applicable* - It is not reasonable to expect this action to be blocked by the target organisation
    * *Not Prevented* - The action occurred as expected without interference from any locked-down configuration or security products
    * *Manual Intervention* - The action was blocked as a result of manual activity instigated by the defensive team
    * *Blocked as Standard* - The action was prevented by an existing technical control, i.e. a configuration or product present as part of the target organisation's business-as-usual
